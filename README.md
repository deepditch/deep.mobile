[Getting started with react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

Follow the instructions provided in the link above to setup your environment for react-native. Be sure to follow the instructions for "Building Projects with Native Code"

Once you've installed all of the react-native dependencies, added the Andriod SDK to path, 
and setup either a physical or virtual andriod device, you can run the following commands to 
setup and debug the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/deepditch/deep.mobile.git
cd deep.mobile
npm install
react-native run-android
