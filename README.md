[Getting started with react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

Follow the instructions provided in the link above to setup your environment for react-native. Be sure to follow the instructions for "Building Projects with Native Code"

Once you've installed all of the react-native dependencies you can run the following commands to 
setup the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/deepditch/deep.mobile.git
cd deep.mobile
npm install
cd ios
pod install
```

From the ios directory, open the deep.mobile.xworkspace file in xCode. From here you should be able to successfully build the xCode project. Build for release if you want to try out the app without being connected to your computer.
